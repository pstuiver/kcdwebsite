            <p>At Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy we understand not only the importance of early ASD intervention but also the impact that ASD can have on the entire family.</p>
            <p>As no two children on the spectrum are the same, great care is taken to develop aims and targets that are specific to each individual child and family’s needs.</p>
            <p>Therapeutic intervention is thus focussed on family involvement and education in order to generalise skills to the home environment and to ensure sustainability of the recommended programs.</p>
            <p>In order to provide a multidisciplinary approach, Elsje Stuiver is experienced in working and communicating with other health care practitioners that might be providing additional therapeutic services to ASD clients.</p>
            <p>Elsje Stuiver is also highly trained and experienced in addressing the following areas that are typically associated with ASD:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Language and communication</strong>: Although this area also requires specialised support from speech and language therapists, Elsje Stuiver&#39;s knowledge in Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) will support your child’s ability to communicate.
