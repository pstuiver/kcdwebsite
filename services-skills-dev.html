        <p>These individual and group treatment sessions focus on teaching children functional skills so that they can
            become more independent in everyday activities.
        </p>
        <p>The need to improve these skills is often identified by the child themselves and addressing them has a
            positive effect on the child&#39;s self-esteem and overall emotional well-being.</p>
        <p> Children with the following difficulties may benefit from skills development: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dyslexia.
            </li>
            <li>
                Motor planning difficulties. (Dyspraxia)
            </li>
            <li>
                Learning difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Visual Impairment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Attention Deficit Disorder.
            </li>

                Intellectual impairment
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy uses a variety of therapeutic techniques in order to further develop the
            child&#39;s functional skills. These include:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Multisensory activities:</strong> Exposing a child to age-appropriate activities that allow
                them to learn through touching, feeling, moving, listening and looking. This is helpful to children who
                have different learning styles. Each sense that is engaged during these activities gives the brain
                additional opportunity to encode and “integrate” the information for future reference.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Behavioural modification:</strong> Desired behaviours such as attending, listening and
                    engaging is encouraged through positive verbal and non-verbal praise as well as pre-determined
                    rewards or activities. Additional visual support such as timers, tokens and visual schedule cards
                    are often used to ensure that the child has a good understanding of what is expected.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <strong>Teaching and coaching:</strong> The child is provided with multiple opportunities to
                    practice new skills. Significant adults are encouraged to demonstrate or model tasks and to break
                    activities into smaller, more manageable steps. Each step is practiced individually before they are
                    combined in order to ensure that the child will have the self-confidence to complete the total
                    skill.</p>


            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Logical thinking and problem solving:</strong> The therapy room becomes a safe space where
                    children can try out new and novel tasks as well as solve old problems. Instead of being given the
                    solution, children are encouraged to work through obstacles, constructional games and abstract
                    concepts in a logical manner and are guided by the therapist to find the solutions themselves. This
                    creates a sense of achievement in many children.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parents, guardians and caregivers are encouraged to attend their child&#39;s therapy sessions as this
            provides an opportunity for training, understanding and interaction with the therapist.</p>
