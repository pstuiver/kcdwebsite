        <p style="margin-top: 0.25em"> Elsje has worked with my daughter since she was three years old. One of the main outcomes was for me to be able to connect with my child on a real level. I will forever be grateful to Elsje for that. In my daughter's later years, Elsje has been able to assist Kate in goal setting, practical exercises and coping skills that a child can understand, implement and as a consequence benefit from. She has been incredible in coaching me as a mom alongside Kate's needs and recognising her strengths. Elsje was open to meeting teachers and therapists in order to share the findings and suggest areas for focus. Elsje shows initiative and real concern and care. My daughter throughly enjoys her sessions and I would travel as far as I needed to to get what Elsje provides as a Therapist.

        <p style="margin-top: 0.25em"> I highly recommend Elsje Stuiver. She is professional and caring. My son adores her and finding a therapist
            who can connect so well with a child with autism is a truly special thing. In a year my son has flourished.
            She has helped him in too many ways to mention and at the same time has imparted her knowledge to help me
            to better understand his behaviours and given practical advice that I am able to use at home. My son
            actually cheers when he knows that he is going to O.T.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0.25em">Elsje Stuiver is exceptional. She has brought a shy and reserved little boy and made him a confident and
            chatty young man. She is passionate, caring and very professional and my son just adores her. She is
            dedicated to helping young children reach their full potential. Lessons with Elsje have really helped my
            son with his fine and gross motor skills and his overall core strength have improved tremendously.</p>
