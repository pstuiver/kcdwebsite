<p>Starting off it will be part-time/afternoon work from 13:00 to 16:00 five days per week, with option to expand to a full-time schedule as your caseload grows.</p>
<p>We offer in-practice and school-based OT to children aged 1-13 years. The majority of our caseload are children with Autism, global developmental delay and special educational needs. We also receive referrals from local mainstream schools to address concentration, handwriting and motor delays.</p> 
<p>Emphasis is placed on being child-centered and family-focussed thus encouraging parents and caregivers to get actively involved in the therapy process.</p>
<p>This role will allow for an opportunity to work within a multidisciplinary team, however, the majority of work will be independent from fellow staff members.</p>
<p>Our existing systems and Apps will be available to streamline administration and practice management.</p>
<p>Occupational Therapists with a minimum of 5 years pediatric work experience are invited to apply. Sensory Integration training is essential and training in DIR or AAC would be beneficial. Registration with the relevant regulatory bodies will be required. You should also have access to your own transport and be willing to commute between Pinetown and Durban North once or twice per week.</p>
<p>Position available as soon as possible</p>
<p>Should you be interested in this position please send a cover letter and CV to info@kidzcandurban.com</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
