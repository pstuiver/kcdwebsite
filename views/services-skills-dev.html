            These individual and group treatment sessions focus on teaching
            children functional skills so that they can become more independent
            in everyday activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The need to improve these skills is often identified by the child
            themselves and addressing them has a positive effect on the child's
            self-esteem and overall emotional well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children with the following difficulties may benefit from skills
            development:
          </p>
          <ul class="views-list-item">
            <li>Dyslexia.</li>
            <li>Motor planning difficulties. (Dyspraxia)</li>
            <li>Learning difficulties.</li>
            <li>Visual Impairment.</li>
            <li>Attention Deficit Disorder.</li>
            <li>Global developmental delays.</li>
            <li>Genetic disorders.</li>
            <li>Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li>
            <li>Intellectual impairment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We employ a variety of therapeutic techniques to develop a child's
            functional skills. These include:
          </p>
          <ul class="views-list-item">
            <li>
              <span class="font-bold">Multisensory activities: </span>Exposing a
              child to age-appropriate activities that allow them to learn
              through touching, feeling, moving, listening and looking.
              <p class="mt-1">
                This is helpful for children who have different learning styles.
                Each sense that is engaged during these activities gives the
                brain additional opportunity to encode and “integrate” the
                information for future reference.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Behavioural modification: </span>Desired
                behaviours such as attending, listening and engaging is
                encouraged through positive verbal and non-verbal praise as well
                as pre-determined rewards or activities.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                Additional visual support such as timers, tokens and visual
                schedule cards are often used to ensure that the child has a
                good understanding of what is expected.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Teaching and coaching: </span>The child
                is provided with multiple opportunities to practice new skills.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                Significant adults are encouraged to demonstrate or model tasks
                and to break activities into smaller, more manageable steps.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                Each step is practised individually before they are combined, to
                ensure that the child will have the self-confidence to complete
                the total skill.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold"
                  >Logical thinking and problem solving: </span
                >The therapy room becomes a safe space where children can try
                out new and novel tasks as well as solve old problems.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                Instead of being given the solution, children are encouraged to
                work through obstacles, constructional games and abstract
                concepts in a logical manner and are guided by the therapist to
                find the solutions themselves.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                This creates a sense of achievement in many children.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Parents, guardians and caregivers are encouraged to attend their
            child's therapy sessions as this provides an opportunity for
            training, understanding and interaction with the therapist.
