            An assessment will typically be the first step in your child and
            your family's Occupational Therapy journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            An assessment provides family members, teachers and caregivers with
            opportunities to share background information and concerns regarding
            the child's development through verbal discussion and the completion
            of written questionnaires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assessment sessions provide our therapists with opportunities to
            interact and engage with a child to establish the child's areas of
            strength and weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Activities during an assessment are focussed on developmental tasks
            and educational games specific to each child's age and abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assessment's outcomes provide valuable insight on how to better
            support the child's every day performance and will guide the
            therapist in developing a comprehensive treatment program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The therapist will make recommendations regarding environmental
            adaptations, assistive devices and equipment, behavioural
            strategies, additional therapy and/or medical support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Occupational Therapy practice offers a variety of assessment
            options specific to your child's age, ability and areas of concern:
