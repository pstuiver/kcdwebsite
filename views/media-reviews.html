            My little one has been with Elsje just over two years. I can truly
            say that Elsje listens to your concerns and addresses them with
            detail. I was very scared at first as I had no idea what an OT did
            or what sessions entailed, but after the first session with Elsje my
            fears were put to rest - knowing that she works with me, and takes
            my concerns seriously and attends to my little one with absolute
            care and professionalism. I get to learn with my little one as Elsje
            gives constant feedback regarding their sessions and what we can do
            from home to help her along.

            We have been seeing Elsje for almost two years and she has been
            absolutely amazing with my now 4 year old. He has grown in leaps and
            bounds since starting OT. Her approach, the many fun tools, work
            space and thoughtfulness on difficult days is what sets her apart
            from a lot of providers. We highly recommend Elsje, sheâ€™s amazing
            with children and parents alike.

            Thank you Elsje for the wonderful work. Your guidance, patience and
            interest shown to our child has helped us as his parents to
            understand and manage his situation better. Your school
            recommendations have also helped us place our child at a school
            where he is best understood and is progressing far more compared to
            where he was in the last couple of years. Our child is a happy boy,
            has self confidence and is doing much better in his academics and
            social behaviour. You are good at what you do and we are grateful
            for all you have done for our boy!

            We have had the most fruitful journey with Elsje as our daughter's
            OT. She started when she was 10 years old and Elsje was a big part
            of her transitioning smoothly into her teens &amp; puberty. Elsje
            has a skill set that enables her to go beyond what you (as a parent)
            present, as challenges &amp; needs - which is so beneficial when you
            set goals for a child on the Autism Spectrum. Our daughter also has
            a severe Speech disorder that requires her to use AAC. Elsje was
            able to adapt sessions brilliantly, to include our ProLoquo App in
            order to synchronise her outcomes &amp; findings with our daughter's
            Speech Therapy Sessions. Today, our daughter is a self-regulated
            teenager who is confident to be in a school setting with other
            special-needs teens &amp; enjoy a full day's schooling environment!
            'Highly recommend Elsje as an OT.

            What an amazing experience! This is probably the most organised
            practice I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Elsje did
            such a great job with my kids, her attitude was excellent and her
            advice spot on. She was professional and her wealth of knowledge is
            evident in the improvement of my children's school work in the short
            time that they saw her. Five stars is honestly an understatement.

            Elsje has worked with my daughter since she was three years old. One
            of the main outcomes was for me to be able to connect with my child
            on a real level. I will forever be grateful to Elsje for that. In my
            daughter's later years, Elsje has been able to assist Kate in goal
            setting, practical exercises and coping skills that a child can
            understand, implement and as a consequence benefit from. She has
            been incredible in coaching me as a mom alongside Kate's needs and
            recognising her strengths. Elsje was open to meeting teachers and
            therapists in order to share the findings and suggest areas for
            focus. Elsje shows initiative and real concern and care. My daughter
            thoroughly enjoys her sessions and I would travel as far as I needed
            to to get what Elsje provides as a Therapist.

            I highly recommend Elsje Stuiver. She is professional and caring. My
            son adores her and finding a therapist who can connect so well with
            a child with autism is a truly special thing. In a year my son has
            flourished. She has helped him in too many ways to mention and at
            the same time has imparted her knowledge to help me to better
            understand his behaviours and given practical advice that I am able
            to use at home. My son actually cheers when he knows that he is
            going to O.T.

            Elsje Stuiver is exceptional. She has brought a shy and reserved
            little boy and made him a confident and chatty young man. She is
            passionate, caring and very professional and my son just adores her.
            She is dedicated to helping young children reach their full
            potential. Lessons with Elsje have really helped my son with his
            fine and gross motor skills and his overall core strength have
            improved tremendously.
