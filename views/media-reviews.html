Your guidance, patience and interest shown to our child has helped us as his parents to understand and manage his situation better. Your school recommendations have also helped us place our child at a school where he is best understood and is progressing far more compared to where he was in the last couple of years. Our child is a happy boy, has self confidence and is doing much better in his academics and social behaviour. You are good at what you do and we are grateful for all you have done for our boy!<div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Zamo Ntuli</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> We have had the most fruitful journey with Elsje as our daughter's OT. She started when she was 10 years old and Elsje was a big part of her transitioning smoothly into her teens & puberty. Elsje has a skill set that enables her to go beyond what you (as a parent) present, as challenges & needs - which is so beneficial when you set goals for a child on the Autism Spectrum. Our daughter also has a severe Speech disorder that requires her to use AAC. Elsje was able to adapt sessions brilliantly, to include our ProLoquo App in order to synchrosnise her outcomes & findings with our daughter's Speech Therapy Sessions. Today, our daughter is a self-regulated teenager who is confident to be in a school setting with other special-needs teens & enjoy a full day's schooling environment! 'Highly recommend Elsje as an OT. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Tamarin Goldblatt</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> So grateful for the time we have had to be in sessions with Elsje. We had sessions over Zoom and it worked out very well for us. We are all very happy with my daughters progress and she is a lot more self-aware than before. I would highly recommend Elsje. My daughter really enjoyed connecting with Elsje. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Alicia K</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> What an amazing experience! This is probably the most organised practice I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Elsje did such a great job with my kids, her attitude was excellent and her advice spot on. She was professional and her wealth of knowledge is evident in the improvement of my children's school work in the short time that they saw her. Five stars is honestly an understatement. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Kathy Morgan</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> Elsje has worked with my daughter since she was three years old. One of the main outcomes was for me to be able to connect with my child on a real level. I will forever be grateful to Elsje for that. In my daughter's later years, Elsje has been able to assist Kate in goal setting, practical exercises and coping skills that a child can understand, implement and as a consequence benefit from. She has been incredible in coaching me as a mom alongside Kate's needs and recognising her strengths. Elsje was open to meeting teachers and therapists in order to share the findings and suggest areas for focus. Elsje shows initiative and real concern and care. My daughter throughly enjoys her sessions and I would travel as far as I needed to to get what Elsje provides as a Therapist. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Melissa Horner</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> I highly recommend Elsje Stuiver. She is professional and caring. My son adores her and finding a therapist who can connect so well with a child with autism is a truly special thing. In a year my son has flourished. She has helped him in too many ways to mention and at the same time has imparted her knowledge to help me to better understand his behaviours and given practical advice that I am able to use at home. My son actually cheers when he knows that he is going to O.T. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Jessica Audouin</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> Elsje Stuiver is exceptional. She has brought a shy and reserved little boy and made him a confident and chatty young man. She is passionate, caring and very professional and my son just adores her. She is dedicated to helping young children reach their full potential. Lessons with Elsje have really helped my son with his fine and gross motor skills and his overall core strength have improved tremendously. </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Vinay Maharaj</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> Elsje has been amazing 2 my son Rehaan who through her therapy on a weekly basis has shown amazing results my wife n i would like to thank u Elsje for ur amazing support and been there for Rehaan and showing him and us a better way of life and helping him 2 achieve his potential thank you for been tolerant with Rehaan when he has his off days but before we leave ur room he is back 2 been all smiles and to Adri thank you for keeping us updated with our appts payments and info we my wife n i would like 2 wish u an amazing festive season n look forward 2 seen u in 2019 </p><div class="flex items-center mt-6"> <div class="font-bold">Eric Prinsloo</div><svg viewBox="0 0 240 48" class="text-yellow-500 ml-2 w-24 sm:w-32 sm:-mt-1" > <title>Five star icon</title> <path d="M24,6 35,42 6,21 42,21 13,42Z"></path> <path d="M72,6 83,42 54,21 90,21 61,42Z"></path> <path d="M120,6 131,42 102,21 138,21 109,42Z"></path> <path d="M168,6 179,42 150,21 186,21 157,42Z"></path> <path d="M216,6 227,42 198,21 234,21 205,42Z"></path> </svg> </div><p class="mt-0"> A great specialist in the autism field.
