            The health care profession is based on a relationship of mutual
            trust between health care practitioners and their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            We care about the security and protection of our client’s
            information and have historically followed the Health Professions
            Council of South Africa (HPCSA) “Guidelines on the keeping of
            patient records”.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we support and strive to comply with The Protection of
            Personal Information Act (POPIA) a South Africa privacy law that
            came into effect on 1 July 2021.
          </p>
          <p class="font-bold">
            How do we comply with information and privacy laws?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-0">
            We conduct periodic reviews of our business processes that deal with
            the personal and medical data of our clients, including how we
            collect, process and store this data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Terms and Conditions include a reference to our Privacy Policy
            (clause 9) and we periodically review and update our Terms and
            Conditions and Privacy Policy.

          <p>
            Our staff and administrative service providers have been made aware
            of and are able to effectively implement our Privacy Policy.

          <p class="font-bold underline">Our Privacy Policy</p>
          <ul class="views-list-item">
            <li>
              We request and store only the client information that is necessary
              for client treatment, medical record-keeping and the effective
              administration of client accounts. As our practice focuses on
              paediatric therapy, patient information is mostly provided by our
              patients’ parents or legal guardians.
            </li>
            <li>
              To assist with the submission of our invoices to a Medical Aid,
              our invoices can reflect information typically required by a
              Medical Aid including client names, contact details, Medical Aid
              membership numbers, ICD 10 codes, etc. However, the inclusion of
              such information is optional and our clients can elect not to
              provide this information to us or not to have this information
              reflected on their invoices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our systems are set up so that clients can provide information in
              electronic format if they prefer. Such information is stored on IT
              systems and computers that are password protected and where the IT
              providers are compliant with POPIA and/or the European General
              Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </li>
            <li>
              If clients provide information in paper format or if client
              records are generated in paper format, these will often be scanned
              into electronic format for storage on the abovementioned IT
              systems. The original paper-based format will however be retained
              and filed off-site in a secure facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              As we are a practice that specialises in paediatric treatment we
              are, according to the HPCSA guidelines, required to keep our
              patient medical records at least until the patient’s 21<sup
                >st</sup
              >
              birthday.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the event of a client completing their therapy with us or
              becoming dormant, we will remove their non-medical data from our
              invoicing system after two years. The reason for the two-year
              timeframe is that clients often request invoicing information that
              is more than a year old, for instance information relating to the
              previous tax year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our clients can request to have their non-medical information
              amended or removed from our IT systems by contacting us on (064)
              899 4748 or by sending an email to info@kidzcandurban.com

              Our website at www.kidzcandurban.com includes a “Contact Us”
