			A sensory diet is a carefully designed, personalised activity plan that regulates the sensory
			input that a child needs to stay focused and organised throughout the day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our brain, through our senses, requires a balanced
			<span class="font-semibold italic">‘diet’</span> in order for us to be able to make sense and function
			in the world that we live in. We naturally experience a variety of sensations during the day that
			impact on our brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a regular, balanced sensory diet, we are better prepared to respond appropriately to the
			demands of the world we live in and able to keep our brain properly energised, organised,
			alert and calm.
		</p>
		<p>
			When children experience difficulties with self-regulation, adults may have to assist them in
			finding the right type of activities to attain the appropriate level of alertness for their
			situation and environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If they are not in an appropriate state of alertness, their attention may be directed towards
			the wrong cues or they may fail to alert at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each child has a unique set of sensory needs and preferences. Generally, a child whose nervous
			system is on
			<span class="font-semibold italic">high trigger</span> or
			<span class="font-semibold italic">too wired</span> needs more calming input, while the child
			who is more
			<span class="font-semibold italic">sluggish</span>
			or <span class="font-semibold italic">tired</span> needs more arousing input.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our therapists can assist children and families to create a balanced sensory diet, that can
			contain both calming and alerting activities to help a child maintain the appropriate levels
			of alertness.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sensory diet will help the child to organise their senses so that they can carry out
			activities to the best of their ability, while feeling happy, calm and relaxed.
