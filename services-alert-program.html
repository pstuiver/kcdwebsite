                The Alert Program was developed by Occupational Therapists to teach children self regulation and to teach adults how to support learning, attending and positive behaviour.</p>
            <p>It uses the analogy that the body is like a car engine sometimes it runs <i>too high</i>, sometimes <i>too low</i> and sometimes <i>just right.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Participation in the Alert Program will provide the child and adults with a common language and words to describe <i>how their engine is running. </i>It will also provide a range of simple, low-budget strategies and activities that can be incorporated easily into the home and into school routines in order to assist the child with feeling <i>just right.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy has further enhanced the Alert Program by adding additional visual support and interactive cue cards to support children with special needs.</p>
