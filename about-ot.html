                <p>Occupational Therapy (OT) is an allied health profession, focused on improving people&#39;s ability to participate in their <b><i>Occupations</i></b>. Occupations are the everyday activities that provide meaning to our lives. Occupations range from daily self-care tasks such as dressing and eating, to attending work or school and the ability to engage in leisure and social activities.
                </p>
                <p>During Occupational Therapy, the client is encouraged to take part in the therapy process by participating in structured and unstructured activities. An Occupational Therapist is trained in activity-analysis and can adapt and develop activities specific to each client&#39;s individual needs. Occupational Therapists aim to minimise the environmental barriers that their clients experience and to increase their client&#39;s participation in meaningful tasks.
                </p>
                <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy focuses on Paediatric Intervention, working with babies and children up to the age of 13 years. Children are best engaged when tasks are fun, novel and playful and our treatment sessions are therefore aimed at involving the child in play-based activities.</p>
                <p>As many of a child&#39;s daily occupations take place at home and at school, we will often assess areas of concern identified by a child&#39;s parents or teachers:</p><b>Developmental delay</b>
