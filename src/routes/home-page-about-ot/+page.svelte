			Occupational Therapy (OT) is an allied health profession, focused on improving people's
			ability to participate in their
			<span class="font-bold italic">Occupations.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="font-bold italic">Occupations</span> are the everyday activities that provide meaning
			to our lives, ranging from self-care tasks such as dressing and eating, to attending work or school
			and the ability to engage in leisure and social activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			During Occupational Therapy, the client is encouraged to take part in the therapy process by
			participating in structured and unstructured activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Occupational Therapists are trained in activity-analysis and can adapt and develop activities,
			to be specific for each client's individual needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Occupational Therapists aim to minimise the environmental barriers that their clients
			experience, to increase their client's participation in meaningful tasks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Occupational Therapy practice focuses on Paediatric intervention, working with babies and
			children up to the age of 13 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			As many of a child's daily occupations take place at home and at school, we will often assess
			areas of concern identified by a child's parents or teachers:

			therefore aimed at involving the child in play-based activities.
