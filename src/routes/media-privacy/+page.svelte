			The health care profession is based on mutual trust between health care practitioners and
			their clients.
		</p>
		<p>
			We care about the security and protection of our client’s information and have historically
			followed the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) “Guidelines on the keeping of
			patient records”.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, we support and strive to comply with The Protection of Personal Information Act
			(POPIA) a South African privacy law that came into effect on 1 July 2021.
		</p>
		<p class="font-bold">How do we comply with information and privacy laws?</p>
		<p class="mt-0">
			We conduct periodic reviews of our business processes that deal with the personal and medical
			data of our clients, including how we collect, process and store this data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Terms and Conditions include a reference to our Privacy Policy (clause 9) and we
			periodically review and update our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our staff and administrative service providers have been made aware of and are able to
			effectively implement our Privacy Policy.

		<p class="font-bold underline">Our Privacy Policy</p>
		<ul class="views-list-item">
			<li>
				We request and store only the client information that is necessary for client treatment,
				medical record-keeping and the effective administration of client accounts. As our practice
				focuses on paediatric therapy, patient information is mostly provided by our patients’
				parents or legal guardians.
			</li>
			<li>
				To assist with the submission of our invoices to a Medical Aid, our invoices can reflect
				information typically required by a Medical Aid including client names, contact details,
				Medical Aid membership numbers, ICD 10 codes, etc. However, the inclusion of such
				information is optional and our clients can elect not to provide this information to us or
				not to have this information reflected on their invoices.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our systems are set up so that clients can provide information in electronic format if they
				prefer. Such information is stored on IT systems and computers that are password protected
				and where the IT providers are compliant with POPIA and/or the European General Data
				Protection Regulation (GDPR).
			</li>
			<li>
				If clients provide information in paper format or if client records are generated in paper
				format, these will often be scanned into electronic format for storage on the abovementioned
				IT systems. The original paper-based format will however be retained and filed off-site in a
				secure facility.
			</li>
			<li>
				As we are a practice that specialises in paediatric treatment we are, according to the HPCSA
				guidelines, required to keep our patient medical records at least until the patient’s 21<sup
					>st</sup>
				birthday.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a client completing their therapy with us or becoming dormant, we will
				remove their non-medical data from our invoicing system after two years. The reason for the
				two-year timeframe is that clients often request invoicing information that is more than a
				year old, for instance information relating to the previous tax year.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our clients can request to have their non-medical information amended or removed from our IT
				systems by contacting us on (064) 899 4748 or by sending an email to info@kidzcandurban.com
			</li>
			<li>
				Our website at www.kidzcandurban.com includes a “Contact Us” facility where visitors can
				voluntarily provide their contact details so that we can respond to them. Other than the
				“Contact Us” facility we do
				<span class="font-semibold italic">not</span> use browser “cookies” or similar technology to
				track, identify or to gather any information about the visitors to our website.
