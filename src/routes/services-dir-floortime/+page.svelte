		<p class="font-bold">DIR - Developmental Individual Difference Relationship Model</p>
		<p>
			<span class="font-bold">DIR</span> is a child and play-based approach where we follow your child's
			lead and interests, while challenging them to move up the emotional developmental ladder.
		</p>
		<p>
			These individual treatment sessions develop skills that are essential for communication,
			building empathetic relationships and laying the foundations for academic performance.
		</p>
		<p>The aim is to:</p>
		<ul class="views-list-item">
			<li>Teach parents/guardians how to assist in helping the child feel calm.</li>
			<li>Develop the child's interest in the world.</li>
			<li>Help the child to engage and relate.</li>
			<li>Encourage two-way communication.</li>
			<li>Expand social interactions.</li>
			<li>Create situations where the child has to solve problems.</li>
			<li>Encourage imaginative play.</li>
			<li>Develop meaningful use of language.</li>
			<li>Facilitate logical thinking.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>Floortime</strong> is a technique at the heart of DIR therapy where we get down on the
			floor and play with the child. These skills are also taught to caregivers during the therapy process
			and are often recommended as a home program.
		</p>
		<p>Children who have difficulties or delays in the following areas may benefit from DIR:</p>
		<ul class="views-list-item">
