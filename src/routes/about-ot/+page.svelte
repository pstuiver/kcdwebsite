			Our Occupational Therapy practice focuses on Paediatric intervention, working with babies and
			children up to the age of 13 years.

			As many of a child's daily occupations take place at home and at school, we will often assess
			areas of concern identified by a child's parents or teachers:

			therefore aimed at involving the child in play-based activities.
