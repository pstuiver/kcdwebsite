				Occupational Therapy (OT) is an allied health profession, focused on
				improving people's ability to participate in their
				<span class="font-bold italic">Occupations.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="font-bold italic">Occupations</span> are the everyday activities
				that provide meaning to our lives, ranging from self-care tasks such as dressing
				and eating, to attending work or school and the ability to engage in leisure
				and social activities.
			</p>
			<p>
				During Occupational Therapy, the client is encouraged to take part in the
				therapy process by participating in structured and unstructured activities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Occupational Therapists are trained in activity-analysis and can adapt and
				develop activities, to be specific for each client's individual needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Occupational Therapists aim to minimise the environmental barriers that
				their clients experience, to increase their client's participation in
				meaningful tasks.

					Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group
					of complex disorders of brain development.
				</p>
				<p>
					ASD is a developmental disability and people with ASD may communicate,
					interact, behave and learn in ways that are different from most other
					people. The learning, thinking, and problem-solving abilities of people with
					ASD can range from gifted to severely impaired.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some people with ASD need high support (a lot of help and intensive
					intervention) while others need low support (less help and less intensive
					intervention).
				</p>
				<p>
					Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised, in varying degrees, by
					difficulties in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication,
					repetitive behaviours and differences in sensory perception.
