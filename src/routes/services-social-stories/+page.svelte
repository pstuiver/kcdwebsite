		<p class="font-bold">Designing Social Stories</p>
		<p>
			Children with special needs may not always have perfect social skills but with Social Stories,
			they can learn and develop their skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			Social stories are simple, personalised tools to help children understand and navigate social
			situations or specific events.
		</p>
		<p>
			They are short narratives using pictures and simple text, to provide information about what to
			expect, how to behave and what others might be thinking or feeling in a given situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Stories can be creatively designed and personalised to suit each childâ€™s specific
			circumstances or interests.
		</p>
		<p>Typically, social stories make a significant impact on children's social behaviour.</p>
		<p>
			They serve as a powerful tool to support social development and to navigate the social world
			with greater ease and understanding.
