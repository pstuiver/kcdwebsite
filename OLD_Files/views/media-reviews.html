						My little one has been with Elsje just over two years. I can truly say that Elsje
						listens to your concerns and addresses them with detail. I was very scared at first as I
						had no idea what an OT did or what sessions entailed, but after the first session with
						Elsje my fears were put to rest - knowing that she works with me, and takes my concerns
						seriously and attends to my little one with absolute care and professionalism. I get to
						learn with my little one as Elsje gives constant feedback regarding their sessions and
						what we can do from home to help her along.

						We have been seeing Elsje for almost two years and she has been absolutely amazing with
						my now 4 year old. He has grown in leaps and bounds since starting OT. Her approach, the
						many fun tools, work space and thoughtfulness on difficult days is what sets her apart
						from a lot of providers. We highly recommend Elsje, she’s amazing with children and
						parents alike.

						Thank you Elsje for the wonderful work. Your guidance, patience and interest shown to
						our child has helped us as his parents to understand and manage his situation better.
						Your school recommendations have also helped us place our child at a school where he is
						best understood and is progressing far more compared to where he was in the last couple
						of years. Our child is a happy boy, has self confidence and is doing much better in his
						academics and social behaviour. You are good at what you do and we are grateful for all

						We have had the most fruitful journey with Elsje as our daughter's OT. She started when
						she was 10 years old and Elsje was a big part of her transitioning smoothly into her
						teens &amp; puberty. Elsje has a skill set that enables her to go beyond what you (as a
						parent) present, as challenges &amp; needs - which is so beneficial when you set goals
						for a child on the Autism Spectrum. Our daughter also has a severe Speech disorder that
						requires her to use AAC. Elsje was able to adapt sessions brilliantly, to include our
						ProLoquo App in order to synchronise her outcomes &amp; findings with our daughter's
						Speech Therapy Sessions. Today, our daughter is a self-regulated teenager who is
						confident to be in a school setting with other special-needs teens &amp; enjoy a full
						day's schooling environment! 'Highly recommend Elsje as an OT.

						Elsje has worked with my daughter since she was three years old. One of the main
						outcomes was for me to be able to connect with my child on a real level. I will forever
						be grateful to Elsje for that. In my daughter's later years, Elsje has been able to
						assist Kate in goal setting, practical exercises and coping skills that a child can
						understand, implement and as a consequence benefit from. She has been incredible in
						coaching me as a mom alongside Kate's needs and recognising her strengths. Elsje was
						open to meeting teachers and therapists in order to share the findings and suggest areas
						for focus. Elsje shows initiative and real concern and care. My daughter thoroughly
						enjoys her sessions and I would travel as far as I needed to to get what Elsje provides
						as a Therapist.
