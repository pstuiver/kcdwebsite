					<p>
						These individual and group treatment sessions focus on teaching children functional
						skills so that they can become more independent in everyday activities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The need to improve these skills is often identified by the child themselves and
						addressing them has a positive effect on the child's self-esteem and overall emotional
						well-being.
					</p>
					<p>Children with the following difficulties may benefit from skills development:</p>
					<ul class="views-list-item">
						<li>Dyslexia.</li>
						<li>Motor planning difficulties. (Dyspraxia)</li>
						<li>Learning difficulties.</li>
						<li>Visual Impairment.</li>
						<li>Attention Deficit Disorder.</li>
						<li>Global developmental delays.</li>
						<li>Genetic disorders.</li>
						<li>Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li>
						<li>Intellectual impairment</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We employ a variety of therapeutic techniques to develop a child's functional skills.
						These include:
					</p>
					<ul class="views-list-item">
						<li>
							<span class="font-bold">Multisensory activities</span> - Exposing a child to
							age-appropriate activities that allow them to learn through touching, feeling, moving,
							listening and looking.
							<p class="mt-1">
								This is helpful for children who have different learning styles. Each sense that is
								engaged during these activities gives the brain additional opportunity to encode and
								“integrate” the information for future reference.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="font-bold">Behavioural modification</span> - Desired behaviours such as
								attending, listening and engaging is encouraged through positive verbal and
								non-verbal praise as well as pre-determined rewards or activities.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">
								Additional visual support such as timers, tokens and visual schedule cards are often
								used to ensure that the child has a good understanding of what is expected.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="font-bold">Teaching and coaching</span> - The child is provided with
								multiple opportunities to practice new skills.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">
								Significant adults are encouraged to demonstrate or model tasks and to break
								activities into smaller, more manageable steps.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">
								Each step is practised individually before they are combined, to ensure that the
								child will have the self-confidence to complete the total skill.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="font-bold">Logical thinking and problem solving </span> - The therapy
								room becomes a safe space where children can try out new and novel tasks as well as
								solve old problems.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">
								Instead of being given the solution, children are encouraged to work through
								obstacles, constructional games and abstract concepts in a logical manner and are
								guided by the therapist to find the solutions themselves.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-1">This creates a sense of achievement in many children.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Parents, guardians and caregivers are encouraged to attend their child's therapy
						sessions as this provides an opportunity for training, understanding and interaction
						with the therapist.
