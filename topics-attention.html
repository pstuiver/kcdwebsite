            <p style="margin-top:6em;">At Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy we recognise that attention and concentration difficulties in children can be caused by a variety of factors, of which only one is ADD or AD(H)D.</p>

            <p>Elsje Stuiver also has the knowledge, experience and qualifications to treat attention and concentration difficulties in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Improve physical strength, balance and endurance in both sitting and handwriting so that a child does not fatigue as quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make recommendations regarding life-style adaptations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improve visual-perceptual delays that may affect the child’s performance during &quot;looking and learning&quot; tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Increase motivation and drive through the implementation of behavioural strategies such as token systems, timers and reward charts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improve ocular motor skills which may be affecting the child’s performance during tasks that require scanning of the environment or tracking of objects such as reading or copying from the board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Address sensory modulation difficulties through the implementation of a <a href="services-sensory-diet.html" target="_self" style="text-decoration: underline;">Sensory Diet</a> or an
