        <p>At Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy we recognise that attention and concentration difficulties in children
            can be caused by a variety of factors, of which only one is ADD or AD(H)D.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive
            <a class="a-deco" href="services-ot-assessment.html" target="_self">Occupational Therapy assessment</a>
            will assist the therapist in identifying the possible areas which may be affecting the child’s ability to
            focus and attend.</p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver also has the experience and qualifications to treat attention and concentration difficulties
            in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Improve physical strength, balance and endurance in both sitting and handwriting so that a child does
                not fatigue as quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make recommendations regarding life-style adaptations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improve visual-perceptual delays that may affect the child’s performance during &quot;looking and
                learning&quot; tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase motivation and drive through the implementation of behavioural strategies such as token
                systems, timers and reward charts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improve ocular motor skills which may be affecting the child’s performance during tasks that require
                scanning of the environment or tracking of objects such as reading or copying from the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Address sensory modulation difficulties through the implementation of a <a class="a-deco" href="services-sensory-diet.html"
                    target="_self">Sensory Diet</a> or an
                <a class="a-deco" href="services-alert-program.html" target="_self">Alert Program</a> depending on the
                child’s needs and abilities.
        </ul>
        <p>Should the cause not be related to OT areas, the therapist will refer the child to other health care or
            medical professionals who will be able to address the concerns.</p>
