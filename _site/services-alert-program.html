        <p>The Alert Program was developed by Occupational Therapists to teach children self-regulation and to teach adults how to support learning, attending and positive behaviour in children.</p>
        <p>It uses the analogy that the body is like a car engine sometimes running <em>too high</em>, sometimes <em>too low</em> and sometimes <em>just right.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Participation in the Alert Program will provide the child and adults with a common language and words to describe how the child's <em>engine is running. </em>ItÂ will also provide a range of simple, low-budget strategies and activities that can be incorporated easily into the home and into school routines, in order to assist the child with feeling <em>just right.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy has enhanced the Alert Program by adding additional visual support and interactive cue cards, to support children with special needs.</p>
