        <p><strong>Developmental Individual Difference Relationship (DIR) Model</strong></p>
        <p>These individual treatment sessions develop skills that are essential for communication and building empathetic relationships and lay the foundations for academic performance.</p>
        <p><strong>DIR</strong> is a child and play-based approach where we follow your child&#39;s lead and interests, while challenging them to move up the emotional developmental ladder.
        </p>
        <p>The aim is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Teach parents/guardians how to assist in helping the child feel calm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop the child&#39;s interest in the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                Help the child to engage and relate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Encourage two-way communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                Expand social interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create situations where the child has to solve problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Encourage imaginative play.
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop meaningful use of language.
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitate logical thinking.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Floortime</strong> is a technique at the heart of DIR therapy where we get down on the floor and play with the child. These skills are also taught to caregivers during the therapy process and are often recommended as a home program.</p>
