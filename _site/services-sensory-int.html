            <p style="margin-top:6em;">Sensory Integration is a post-graduate field of study that is specific to Occupational Therapy. Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy offers Sensory Integration assessment and treatment options.</p>
            <p>Sensory Iintegration was developed from a body of work by <a href="http://www.efrconline.org/admin/files/Parent%27sGuideToSI.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Jean Ayres &#40;PhD&#41;</a> and other occupational and physical therapists.</p>
            <p>In addition, literature from fields such as neuropsychology, neurology, physiology, child development and psychology has contributed to Sensory Integration theory development and treatment techniques.</p>
            <p>Not all children with learning, developmental, or behavioural problems have underlying sensory integrative difficulties, however the following observations are possible signs of Sensory Integration dysfunction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Activity levels that are unusually high or low.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overly sensitive to touch, movement, sights or sounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under-reactive to sensory stimulation. May seem oblivious to pain or to body position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seeking out intense sensory experiences i.e. body whirling or crashing into objects.</li>
                <li>
                    Coordination problems and/or unusually poor balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Difficulty learning new tasks that require motor coordination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Delayed speech, motor skills or academic achievement despite normal intelligence. </li>
                <li>
                    Poor organisation of behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Impulsivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Difficulty adjusting to new situations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Poor self concept.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoidance or withdrawal from tasks and activities that peers enjoy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetitive or compulsive behaviours.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Elsje Stuiver&#39;s Occupational Therapy practice is full of appealing sensory equipment: platforms to swing on, bolsters to climb over, trampolines to jump on and ball pools to play in.</p>
            <p>For a child, Sensory Integration therapy is like play and it may look like mere play to the adult observer but it is important work, as with the guidance of a trained professional, the child can learn to overcome issues that probably would not have been addressed in an unguided play environment.</p>
            <p>At Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy the therapist&#39;s knowledge, experience and qualifications enable treatment to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Desensitise the child&#39;s sensory sensitivities by slowly and respectfully exposing them to specific sensory activities.</li>
                <li>
                    Gradually increase the demands on the child to result in an organised and more mature response to sensory input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Equip parents, guardians and/or teachers with skills to assist the child to feel calm and focussed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assist the child to develop age-appropriate self-regulation strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improve sensory discrimination so that the child will develop underlying abilities that will enable them to learn new skills, interact positively with peers, play more creatively and achieve success in activities at home and at school.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to achieve these aims the therapist may recommend the implementation of a
                <a href="services-sensory-diet.html" target="_self" style="text-decoration: underline;">Sensory Diet</a> or an
                <a href="services-alert-program.html" target="_self" style="text-decoration: underline;">Alert Program</a> depending on the child&#39;s needs and abilities.</p>
