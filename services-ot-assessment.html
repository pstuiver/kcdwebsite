            <p style="margin-top:7em; ">An assessment will almost always be the first step in your child&#39;s and family&#39;s OT journey. An assessment provides family members, teachers and caregivers with an opportunity to share background information and concerns regarding the child&#39;s development, through verbal discussion and the completion of written questionnaires.</p>
            <p>The assessment&#39;s activities are focussed on developmental tasks and educational games specific to each child&#39;s age and abilities. The assessment session provides the therapist with an opportunity to interact and engage with the child in order to establish their areas of strength and weakness.</p>
            <p>The assessment&#39;s outcomes provide valuable insight into how to better support your child&#39;s every day performance and guide the therapist in developing a comprehensive treatment program. The therapist will also make recommendations with regards to environmental adaptation, assistive devices and equipment, behavioural strategies, additional therapy and/or medical support.</p>
            <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy offers a variety of assessment options specific to your child&#39;s age, ability and areas of concern:</p>
