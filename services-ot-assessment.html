    </div>
    <div class="info-content blue-text-white-bg">
        <p>An assessment will almost always be the first step in your child and family&#39;s Occupational Therapy journey. An assessment provides family members, teachers and caregivers with an opportunity to share background information and concerns regarding the child&#39;s development through verbal discussion and the completion of written questionnaires.</p>
        <p>Activities during the assessment are focussed on developmental tasks and educational games specific to each child&#39;s age and abilities. The assessment session provides the therapist with an opportunity to interact and engage with the child in order to establish the child&#39;s areas of strength and weakness.</p>
        <p>The assessment&#39;s outcomes provide valuable insight on how to better support your child&#39;s every day performance and guide the therapist in developing a comprehensive treatment program. The therapist will also make recommendations with regards to environmental adaptation, assistive devices and equipment, behavioural strategies, additional therapy and/or medical support.</p>
        <p>Elsje Stuiver Occupational Therapy offers a variety of assessment options specific to your child&#39;s age, ability and areas of concern:</p>
